# Depop Sentiment Analysis: From 3.8 to 4.3 Stars ðŸš€

This is the project that helped me land my position at Depop! During the interview process, I was tasked with presenting a previous project I had worked on. Initially, I wasn't fully convinced with what I had prepared, but then an idea struck me. ðŸ’¡

I thought, **"What if I add a novel twist to my previous projects to make it personalized for Depop?"**

## How It All Began

I decided to focus on analyzing **Depopâ€™s Android app reviews**. At the time, the app had a **3.8-star rating**, and I wanted to understand why users were dissatisfied. I scraped publicly available reviews using **NLP techniques** to extract insights from the data.

My goal was to identify:
- Common reasons for user dissatisfaction
- Specific areas where the app could be improved

## The Process

Using **Python** and **NLP techniques**, I:
- Scraped user reviews for the Depop Android app from the Google Play Store.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data.
- Applied sentiment analysis to identify patterns and key themes in the feedback.
- Presented my findings to Depopâ€™s senior data scientists, suggesting actionable steps to improve the app's user experience.

## Results

The analysis and suggestions I provided helped improve the Android app's rating, which increased from **3.8 to 4.3 stars**.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis
- **NLP**: To analyze text data from reviews
- **Plotly**: For visualizing trends and insights
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **Google Play Scraper**: To collect reviews from the Google Play Store

## Presentation

I created a detailed presentation summarizing the findings, insights, and suggestions for Depop.

### Key Details for "How to Run":
1. **Clone the Repository**: It allows users to copy your repository to their local machine.
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: Itâ€™s always good practice to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Using `pip install -r requirements.txt` ensures that all necessary libraries are installed for the project.
4. **Running the Jupyter Notebook**: Instructions for launching Jupyter and opening the notebook.

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file if you haven't already, listing the dependencies your project uses. You can generate it with:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
