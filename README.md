Depop Sentiment Analysis: From 3.8 to 4.3 Stars ðŸš€
This is the project that helped me land my position at Depop! During the interview process, I was tasked with presenting a previous project I had worked on. Initially, I wasn't fully convinced with what I had prepared, but then an idea struck me. ðŸ’¡

I thought, "What if I add a novel twist to my previous projects to make it personalized for Depop?"

How It All Began
I decided to focus on analyzing Depopâ€™s Android app reviews. At the time, the app had a 3.8-star rating, and I wanted to understand why users were dissatisfied. I scraped publicly available reviews using NLP techniques to extract insights from the data.

My goal was to identify:

Common reasons for user dissatisfaction
Specific areas where the app could be improved
The Process
Using Python and NLP techniques, I:

Scraped user reviews for the Depop Android app from the Google Play Store.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data.
Applied sentiment analysis to identify patterns and key themes in the feedback.
Presented my findings to Depopâ€™s senior data scientists, suggesting actionable steps to improve the app's user experience.
Results
The analysis and suggestions I provided helped improve the Android app's rating, which increased from 3.8 to 4.3 stars.
